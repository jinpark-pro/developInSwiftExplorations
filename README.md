# Develop in Swift Explorations

## Values

### Constants and Variables

- ```swift
    // Declaring a constant
    let placeOfBirth = "New Jersey"

    // Declaring a variable
    var currentLocation = "New Jersey"

    // Assigning a new value to a variable
    currentLocation = "California"
  ```

- In most ways, constants and variables are the same:
  - Both use the same rules for names
  - Both associate a name with an assigned value
  - Both have a specific type
- The difference is:
  - The value of a constant cannot be changed after it's first assigned.
  - The value of a variable can be changed after it's first assigned.
- Values declared with let are constants, and can’t be changed once a value is assigned. These values are called immutable.
- Values declared with var are variables, and can be assigned new values over time. These values are called mutable.
- A mutable value can be used as part of an assignment statement to itself: score = score + 10.
- Compound assignment operators allow mutable values to be updated: score += 10.
- Using constants and variables in the correct places helps make your code safer and easier to understand.
- Error Indicator
  - The normal error indicator is a red circle with a white x in it.
  - But an error indicator having an idea how to fix the error on Xcode is a red circle with a white dot in it.
    - a Fix-it will fix errors in your code, but the fix might not be what you meant to do.
    - The Fix-it is trying to be helpful, but it could be suggesting that you make something mutable that you wanted to stay immutable.
- special string syntax for long text

  - ```swift
      let manyLineString =
      """
      This is a long string.
      It can be interpolated \(1) or any number of times. You don't have to escape "quote marks."

      And it can contain empty lines, like the one above.
      Just use three quotes on their own lines to open and close it.
      """
    ```

### Design For People

## Algorithms

### Get Started With Algorithms

- An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task.
- There are three essential building blocks in all algorithms: `sequencing`, `selection`, and `iteration`.
- Sequencing
  - Arranging instructions in order is called sequencing, and it's one of basic techniques for creating an algorithm.
  - Swift uses sequencing as it executes your code line by line and from top to bottom.
- Selection
  - Selection lets you describe multiple paths through your algorithm.
  - By using selection, you can examine the conditions at the time your code runs and your program will proceed along one of many possible paths.
- Functions
  - In Swift, you use functions to group instructions together and give them a name.
  - By breaking a problem into pieces, you can write functions to solve each piece independently.
  - You can combine them to solve the bigger problem.
  - The approach of grouping instructions into a unit and giving that unit a name is call `procedural abstraction`.
  - Remember, the key feature of any kind of abstraction is to hide, or encapsulate, the details of how something works.
  - After you've written and tested a function, you no longer have to think about how it works, just about what it does.
- Types
  - Swift uses the term type to describe each different kind of value.
- Parameters
  - You use parameters to define the input that goes into a function.
  - Each parameter for a function has a type.
  - By adding parameters to functions, you can make them more flexible so they can be used in a variety of situations.
- Making Decisions with Booleans
  - The yes-and-no answers are represented in Swift as "true" and "false."
  - They are known as Boolean values, named after George Boole, a 19th century mathematician.
  - The Bool type is used in Swift to represent Boolean values.

### Play with Programs

- Functions

  - Reusability is a large part of what makes functions so powerful.
  - Any identifier followed by parentheses, `()`, is a function.
  - The code between the two braces, `{...}`, is called the body of the function.
  - Nothing is displayed in the results because declaring a function only describes what the function would do if it ever run.
  - To actually run the code, you have to call the function. Typing the name of the function will call the function.
  - Decomposition: break a single long list down into multiple smaller lists.

- Types

  - String
  - Number is Int, an abbreviation of integer.
  - Swift keeps track of the type of the variable and makes sure you don't accidentally try to assign a value of a different type.
    - The value of a variable can change, but the type of the variable can't change.
  - Type Safety: Swift won't let you write code that uses types incorrectly or unexpectedly.
    - Another instance of type safety would occur if you tried to add values of different types.
  - A literal is the simplest form of expression.
  - Swift makes assumptions about what types the literals are meant to be.
    - Any value inside double quotes will be treated as a String, and a whole number will be treated as an Int.
    - Type Inference: Swift uses context clues from code to infer what type something is.
  - Check the type by holding down the `Option` key while clicking a variable.
  - You can add an extra piece of information, called a `type annotation`, to tell Swift exactly what type you want to use.
    - `let annotationDouble: Double = 20`
    - `annotationDouble` is a Double, even though there is no decimal point, because of the type annotation.
  - All type names begin with a capital letter. If there are multiple words the first letter of each word is also capitalized.
    - This is slightly different from the rules for naming constants, variables, and functions, which all begin with lower-case letters.
  - Types and capabilities can be grouped together into collections called `frameworks` or `libraries`.
    - To use a framework in your program, you have to import it like `import Foundation`.

- Parameters and Results

  - Declare: `func functionName(parameter: Type) {...}`
  - Call: `functionName(parameter: argument)`
  - Passing a value back when a function is finished is called returning a value. To declare a function that returns a value, you have to add two things to your code.
    - After your list of parameters, add a text arrow `->` and the type of value to be returned.
    - Then you have to end the body of the function with a return statement that gives that type fo value back.
    - `func functionName(parameter: Type) -> Type { ... return ...}`
    - Your function can have multiple parameters, but it can only return one value.
  - When a function does some kind of work that's unrelated to a return value, like printing to the console, the work is call a `side effect`.
    - When you name a function, it's good to somehow include the side effect in the name.
    - If a function has no return value, all of its work is considered a side effect.
    - A function that has a side effect should have a verb in the name.
  - The order that code executes in a program is called `control flow`.
  - When your code calls a function, the following line doesn't execute until after the function returns.
  - `func functionName(argumentLabel parameterName: Type) {...}`

    - ```swift
        func printHello(to name: String) {
          print("Hello " + name)
        }
        printHello(to: "Chris")
      ```

  - To declare a parameter without an argument label, you use the underscore `_` where the argument label would go.
  - In Swift, the underscore means "I don't care about this item because I'm not going to use it."

    - ```swift
        func printHelloTo(_ name: String) {
          print("Hello " + name)
        }
        printHelloTo("John")
      ```

- Making Decisions

  - Clean code
  - Conditionals are perfect opportunities to write helpful functions. If you have some decision-making code that doesn't read easily or makes things look to complicated, you can wrap it in a function and make it look like you're asking a question.

    - ```swift
        if gearWeight < totalCarryingCapacity {
            if bulkiestItemWeight < 80 {
                "Rock on."
            } else if chanceOfRain >= 0.1 {
                "Everyone quits! Looks like you've got a solo show."
            }
        } else {
            "Everyone quits! Looks like you've got a solo show."
        }
      ```

    - ```swift
        if gearWeight < totalCarryingCapacity && (chanceOfRain < 0.1 || bulkiestItemWeight < 80) {
            "Rock on."
        } else {
            "Everyone quits! Looks like you've got a solo show."
        }
      ```

    - ```swift
        func bandCanCarryGear(bandMemberCount: Int, gearWeight: Int, bulkiestItemWeight: Int, chanceOfRain: Double) -> Bool {
            let maximumTripCount = 2
            let weightPerPerson = 50
            let totalCarryingCapacity = bandMemberCount * weightPerPerson * maximumTripCount

            return gearWeight < totalCarryingCapacity && (chanceOfRain < 0.1 || bulkiestItemWeight < 80)
        }
        if bandCanCarryGear(bandMemberCount: 5, gearWeight: 650, bulkiestItemWeight: 60, chanceOfRain: 0.05) {
            "Rock on."
        } else {
            "Everyone quits! Looks like you've got a solo show."
        }
      ```

  - Functions are the way programmers group blocks of work together.
    - A function is reusable, which saves on reading and typing.
    - A function can be understood on its own, so you don't have to think of every single step.
    - If a function is changed, the changes apply everywhere the function is used.

- Data Visualization

### Build a QuestionBot App

- Rather than running the app several times as you develop your code, you can use a playground to get your question answerer up and running more quickly.
- You can see multiple results instantly, and there's no need to return.
- Once you're happy with your code, you'll use it to replace the existing code segment in QuestionBot.

#### Building Your Function

- QuestionAnswerer.playground

  - ```swift
      import Foundation
      func responseTo(question: String) -> String {
          let lowerQuestion = question.lowercased()

          if lowerQuestion.hasPrefix("hello") {
              return "Why, hello there"
          } else if lowerQuestion.hasPrefix("where are the cookies?") {
              return "In the cookie jar!"
          } else if lowerQuestion.hasPrefix("where") {
              return "To the North"
          } else if lowerQuestion.hasPrefix("can i") {
              return "Yes, you can"
          } else if lowerQuestion.contains("your name") {
              return "My name is QuestionBot."
          } else if lowerQuestion.contains("what time") {
              return "\(Calendar.current.component(.hour, from: Date())):\(Calendar.current.component(.minute, from: Date()))"
          } else {
              if lowerQuestion.count % 2 == 0 {
                  return "Thank you for asking, but I have no idea."
              } else {
                  return "Please ask it tomorrow."
              }
          }
      }

      responseTo(question: "Hello there")
      responseTo(question: "Where are the cookies?")
      responseTo(question: "Where should I go on holiday?")
      responseTo(question: "Can I have a cookie?")
      responseTo(question: "Should I go?")
      responseTo(question: "What time is it?")
    ```

#### Updating the App

- common problems:
  - **The app runs but you don't see the answers** you were expecting. This is probably because you pasted the function in the wrong place. Perhaps it was in the wrong file, or in the wrong place in the correct file.
  - The app doesn't build with an error that reads **Unexpected non-nil return value in void function**. You probably pasted the function body code from the playground into the wrong function in the project.
  - The app doesn't build with an error that reads **Invalid redeclaration of responseTo(question:)**. This means you have two functions with the same name in the same area of the code - not allowed because it isn't clear which function should run when called.
  - The app doesn't build with an error that reads **Expected declaration**. You may have inadvertently replaced the entire function, declaration and all, with only the body of the function from your playground, or you pasted the function body into the wrong place.
  - The app doesn't build with an error that reads **Missing return in a function expected to return 'String'**. You probably pasted an entire function inside another one.
  - The app doesn't build with an error that reads **Closure expression is unused** or **Expressions are not allowed at the top level**. You probably pasted the body of your function into a file without any context - with no `func` keyword.
  - The app doesn't build with an error that reads **Use of unresolved identifier 'MyQuestionAnswerer'**. You probably replaced the entire `struct MyQuestionAnswerer` with the `responseToQuestion` function or its body.
